# Genetic_Algorithm_For_Hyperparameter_Tuning

Hyperparameters in ML control various aspects of training, and finding optimal values for them can be a challenge.
Traditional methods like grid searches can quickly become intractable due to:

* the high dimensional search space
* unknown correlations among the dimensions, and
* expensive nature of evaluating the fitness at each point, making GA a suitable candidate for hyperparameter searches.
